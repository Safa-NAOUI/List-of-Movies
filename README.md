Android Room in Kotlin ,Coroutines flow and LiveData

## Room: 
The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.


## Coroutines:

Is light wight threads for asynchronous programming, Coroutines not only open the doors to asynchronous programming, but also provide a wealth of other possibilities such as concurrency, actors, etc.


## Kotlin flow: 

I'll use Kotlin Flow to get notified of every change in the table.
